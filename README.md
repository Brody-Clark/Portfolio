# Brody Clark Portfolio

The purpose of this application is to showcase an understanding of responsive web design using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. It features a development portfolio including a short bio, education history, professional experience, projects, and a contact form. There is a nav bar to automatically navigate to the various sections as well as a demo searchbar that can be updated to include key site links. There is also a footer that includes relevant social media links and a copyright statement.

## Build and Run
